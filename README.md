# CEM Block Chain

Crypto Emergency BlockChain is a product developed based on
Ethereum Blockchain. The idea for the technology was formed
after the need to implement interconnected products that are part
of a single company ecosystem, as well as the possibility of
creating its own independent blockchain, not tied to other
technological solutions and infrastructure. This will allow us to
scale our own infrastructure and take us to a deeper level, as well
as accelerate the overall development front of the entire Crypto
Emergency ecosystem. Our blockchain will also be used in other
products of our company. Also, other startups (companies) from
any industry will be able to use Crypto Emergency's blockchain
infrastructure.

At the moment, blockchain is already in use at the main Crypto
Emergency project:

CEM Coin will be integrated into the platform and will be used as
a social token. Token holders will be able to receive benefits on the
platform, giving them the right to vote and affecting the life of the
project as a whole;
